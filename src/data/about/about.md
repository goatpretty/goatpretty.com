我是抽象的美羊羊。

终于，这个博客的基础功能总算完成并顺利上线了。它是我的第一个正式博客，采用的是 Astro 这一前端框架。选择它，其实最初是因为 ChatGPT 的推荐——在众多主题模板中，我一眼就被 <a href="https://github.com/LuoYuXuanRyan/radish_garden" target="_blank"><strong>radish_garden</strong></a> 吸引了。对于初学者来说，Astro 的构建体验也相当友好，既能保持高性能，又能兼容多种前端框架，让人乐在其中。

我真正开始接触排版是在高一。那时候我在 Word 里鼓捣试卷排版，用 MathType 写公式，觉得挺有意思。后来接触到 EduEditor，能画点学科插图，我就彻底上头了。
再后来，我玩起了方正书版、方正飞翔，还摸索着用 Illustrator 做点矢量图。从那以后，我就喜欢在作品里加点干净利落的图形元素。
后来我还学会了用插件拼 PDF 页面，做出来的排版更整齐、更有设计感。
现在，我正在准备做一个 **“方正书版排卷教程”**，希望能让更多人入坑。

现在，这个博客托管在 Cloudflare Pages 上，运行稳定且访问速度理想。接下来，我计划持续完善网站的各项功能，并陆续更新一些与排版设计相关的基础教程。希望这个小小的空间，能成为交流与分享灵感的地方。

我是抽象的美羊羊，祝你好运，也希望你能在自己的世界里找到属于你的灵感。

I'm **PrettyGoat**.

Finally, the basic features of this blog are completed and it's officially online. This is my very first personal blog, built with the **Astro** front-end framework. I chose it because ChatGPT recommended it — and among all the themes I browsed, I was immediately drawn to <a href="https://github.com/LuoYuXuanRyan/radish_garden" target="_blank"><strong>radish_garden</strong></a>. For beginners, Astro offers a smooth and enjoyable development experience: it's fast, flexible, and works beautifully with other frameworks.

I first got into **typesetting** back in high school. At that time, I loved experimenting with **Word**, playing around with exam paper layouts, and using **MathType** to write formulas — it was surprisingly fun. Later, I discovered **EduEditor**, which allowed me to draw subject illustrations, and I completely fell in love with layout design.

Then I started learning **Founder Typesetting (方正书版)** and **Founder Feixiang**, and also explored **Adobe Illustrator** for vector graphics. Since then, I’ve enjoyed adding clean and precise vector elements to my works. Later, I learned how to use plugins to combine and format PDF files, which made my layouts look much more professional and organized. Now, I’m working on a tutorial called **“Founder Typesetting for Exam Layouts”**, hoping to help more people discover the fun of professional typesetting.

This blog is hosted on **Cloudflare Pages**, which runs smoothly and provides great performance. Next, I plan to continue improving the site’s features and post more tutorials about design and typography. I hope this small space can become a place for sharing ideas and inspiration.

I’m **PrettyGoat**, wishing you good luck — and may you find your own spark of creativity in this world.
